Position 

1. There are 5 position values:
        1. "relative" positions an element relative to where it normally should be

        2. "fixed", with fixed an element is positioned relative to the viewport meaning the web browser 

        3. "absolute", an element is positioned relative to its nearest ancestor. think of an ancestor as a containing class within box one

        4. "sticky", a sticky element is positioned base on the current scroll position meaning our scroll bar

        5. "static", it is a default position for an element

2. relative 
        1. if we set top to be 100px, this element will be pushed downwards by 100px relative to where it normally is

#file index.html (only body)
<body>
    <div id="box1"></div>    
</body>

#file style.css
#box1{
    width: 200px;
    height: 200px;
    background-color: aquamarine;
    position: relative;
    top: 100px;
    left: 100px;
}

3. fixed
        1. an element is fixed in my viewport (my web browser) even though we scroll down the web browser

        2. it might be good for an advertisement if we had a banner

4. absolute
        1. for example, box2 is contained within box1. so, box1 is its nearest ancestor. if we move box1, box2 is still going to stay the same place within box1

example
file index.html (only body)
<body>
    <div id="box1">
        <div id="box2"></div>
    </div>    
</body>


#file style.css
#box1{
    width: 200px;
    height: 200px;
    background-color: aquamarine;
    position: relative;
    /* top:100px; */
    /* left: 100px; */
}

#box2{
    width: 100px;
    height: 100px;
    background-color: rgb(255, 157, 127);
    position: absolute;
}

5. sticky
        1. when we scroll down our web browser is going to catch the element

        2. sticky is kind of similar to fixed, but sticky will reserve some space for the original element

        3. มันจะไม่ทับข้อความ

        4. our element won't be overlapped the text until we scroll down the scroll bar

6. static
        1. to be continue

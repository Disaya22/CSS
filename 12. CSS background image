Background Image

1. background-image: url(file path);
        1. import file image
        2. it the img is a high solution picture, we can add suffix -small to shrink the img

2. background-repeat: no-repeat;

3. background-position: center;
        1. center the img in the middle of our viewport

4. background-attachment: fixed;
        1. this property sets whether a background image scrolls with the rest of the page or is it fixed
        2. now, we set it to be fixed
        3. so, the img is in the middle of viewport even we were to expand or contract it

5. background-size: cover;
        1. make the img take up the entire space of the background

example 
#file style.css

body{
    background-image: url(shinchan.jpg);
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    background-position: center;
    background-attachment: fixed;
    background-size: cover;
}

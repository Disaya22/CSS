Display property

1. Display property is a property that specifies 
if or how an element is displayed.

2. now HTML elements they have a default display value, 
block level or inline

3. an element that is block-lever starts on a new line, take up the full width available (h1, div, p, form, header, footer)

4. inline elements do not start on a new line, width is limited to what is needed (span, a, img)  

5. div element takes up the entire width
   span element stays the same

6. span can not define the width and height

7. we can change the behavior of these elements by utilize the display property

        1. we can apply a width and height, if we set span element to display as a block

        2. inline-block, it’s much like inline but we can also apply a width and a height 

        3. none will effectively erase that element

8. visibility property is quite similar to display
        1. if we set hidden to our element, this element is hidden but it’s still taking up space as if it was still there

#file index.html

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <title>Document</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>

<body>
   
    <div>div</div>
    <span>span</span>
</body>
</html>


#file style.css

div{
    background-color: hsl(0, 85%, 75%);
    width: 100px;
    height: 100px;
    /* display: block; */
    /* visibility: hidden; */
}
    span{
    background-color: hsl(240, 61%, 70%);
    width: 100px;
    height: 100px;
    /* display: inline; */
}
